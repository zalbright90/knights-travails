# knights-travails
A classic example of a graph traversal problem, where we need to find the shortest path in an implicit graph. A JavaScript implementation of a knight's shortest path traversal using Breadth-First Search (BFS) on an 8x8 chessboard.

## Features
- Calculates the shortest path for a knight from a given start position to a target position.
- Uses graph traversal (BFS) to ensure the shortest path is found.
- Outputs the sequence of moves taken.
